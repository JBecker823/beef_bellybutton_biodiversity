# beef_bellybutton_biodiversity

Roza wanted to utilize the Belly Button data samples and program a functioning website with interactive graphs to show the results. This study was performed to determine the different bacteria in belly buttons with a search for a specific type of bacteria. The results analyzed the samples.json file that was given. Roza created line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts while using D3.json to fetch external data. 

By using javascript Roza was able to create her charts and graphs by using VS Code, Google Chrome, Plotly and Github Live.
